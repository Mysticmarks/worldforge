# Worldforge System Audit – 2024-05-30

## 1. State-Space Assessment

### 1.1 Architecture Overview
- The monorepo provides all major Worldforge components, including the Cyphesis server, Ember client, Metaserver lobby, and supporting libraries such as Eris, Squall, WFMath, Mercator, Atlas, and Varconf for networking, math, terrain, and configuration concerns.【F:README.md†L16-L43】
- Each application directory contains source, tests, tools, and documentation subtrees, reflecting a modular layout for server, client, and metaserver responsibilities.【F:apps/cyphesis/README.md†L1-L43】【F:apps/ember/README.md†L1-L43】
- Build orchestration is centralized through CMake with Conan supplying third-party dependencies, enabling consistent cross-platform builds on Linux and Windows.【F:README.md†L45-L123】

### 1.2 Algorithms and Complexity Notes
- Cyphesis exposes features such as behavioral-tree-driven AI, physics simulation, and navigation mesh configuration that imply computationally intensive subsystems which should be profiled for scalability (e.g., navigation slope tuning, visibility broadphase handles).【F:apps/cyphesis/README.md†L9-L43】
- Ember mirrors navigation mesh tunables on the client, indicating shared pathfinding heuristics that must remain numerically stable under large world sizes.【F:apps/ember/README.md†L13-L27】

### 1.3 Security and Configuration Posture
- Configuration management relies on Varconf-backed `.vconf` files; security reviews should validate defaults for server daemonization and remote administration before production deployment.【F:apps/cyphesis/README.md†L44-L68】

### 1.4 Testing and Quality Gates
- The documented workflow enables CTest-based suites, with cppunit and pytest coverage toggled via `-DBUILD_TESTING=ON`. Ensuring these tests run in CI is critical for regression safety.【F:README.md†L74-L107】

### 1.5 Infrastructure & Deployment Pipeline
- Current pipeline leverages Conan-generated CMake presets and publishes prebuilt artifacts via GitHub Actions; release assets require checksum verification before rollout.【F:README.md†L83-L154】

## 2. Optimization Roadmap
- **Short term (stability):** Automate execution of the documented `check` target in CI to guarantee cppunit/pytest coverage on every merge. Harden configuration defaults by codifying recommended `.vconf` baselines for production servers.【F:README.md†L83-L107】【F:apps/cyphesis/README.md†L44-L68】
- **Mid term (scalability):** Profile navigation mesh generation and visibility broadphase limits under load, capturing metrics to inform default tuning for large persistent worlds.【F:apps/cyphesis/README.md†L19-L43】
- **Long term (maintainability):** Consolidate component design docs into a top-level knowledge base and ensure release artifact verification (hash checking) is scripted for operators.【F:README.md†L131-L154】

## 3. Iteration 0 → 1 Transformation Summary
- Established an initial audit document to baseline architecture, quality gates, and optimization roadmap, creating a reproducible artifact for future gradient-descent refinements.

## 4. Deployment Impact
- Documentation-only iteration; no binaries or infrastructure were modified. Deployment posture remains unchanged while providing guidance for subsequent automation.
