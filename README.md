The [WorldForge](http://worldforge.org/ "The main Worldforge site") project lets you create virtual world system.
We provide servers, clients, tools, protocol and media. You provide the world. Everything we do is Free Software.

This is the main monorepo which contains all the components needed for you to either host or access a Worldforge virtual
world.

Some of the features we provide.

* Fully scriptable through Python
* Live reload of both rules and world entities; edit your world without having to shut down or reload
* Complete 3d physics simulation
* Complex AI system, using Behavioral Trees and Python scripts
* Out-of-process AI, allowing for distributed AI clients
* Persistence through either SQLite or PostgreSQL
* Powerful built in rules for visibility and containment of entities
* Emergent gameplay through multiple simple systems interacting
* Quick and powerful procedural terrain generation

## Components

These components make up the Worldforge system. Each of them in turn contains a README file which explains more about
how they work.

* The [Cyphesis](apps/cyphesis/README.md) server is used for hosting a virtual world.
* The [Ember](apps/ember/README.md) client is the main graphical client.
* [Eris](libs/eris/README.md) is a client support library.
* [Squall](libs/squall/README.md) provides features for syncing assets between servers and clients.
* [WFMath](libs/wfmath/README.md) contains various math related functions.
* [Mercator](libs/mercator/README.md) provides features for generating procedural terrain.
* [Atlas](libs/atlas/README.md) handles all communication between different components.
* [Varconf](libs/varconf/README.md) provides configuration support.

## Installation

The simplest way to install all required dependencies is by using
[Conan](https://www.conan.io). This setup requires CMake 3.23+.

Make sure you have installed a c++ compiler (g++ or clang), Conan,
CMake, Subversion and ImageMagick (if you're building the server).

### Dependency setup

Conan provides all thirdâ€‘party libraries, including runtime components
like `spdlog` and the `cppunit` test framework. Begin by detecting a
profile and adding the Worldforge remote, which hosts custom packages
such as `ogre-next` and `cegui`. If the remote requires credentials,
export `CONAN_LOGIN_USERNAME` and `CONAN_PASSWORD` before the install.

```bash
conan profile detect --force
conan remote add worldforge https://artifactory.ogenvik.org/artifactory/api/conan/conan-local
conan install . --build missing -c tools.system.package_manager:mode=install -c tools.system.package_manager:sudo=True
```

### Build and installation

Once dependencies are installed configure and build:

```bash
cmake --preset conan-release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./build/install/release
cmake --build --preset conan-release -j --target all
cmake --build --preset conan-release -j --target install
cmake --build --preset conan-release -j --target mediarepo-checkout
cmake --build --preset conan-release -j --target media-process-install
```

The last two invocations are only needed if you also want to host your own server.

NOTE: The invocation of the target "media-process-install" is optional. It will go through the raw Subversion assets and
convert .png to .dds as well as scaling down textures. If you omit this step Cyphesis will instead use the raw
Subversion media. Which you might want if you're developing locally.
This step also requires ImageMagick to be installed.

If you only want to build the server or the client you can supply these options to the "conan install..." command:
"-o Worldforge/*:with_client=False" or "-o Worldforge/*:with_server=False".

### Prebuilt CI artifacts

Our continuous integration builds precompiled binaries in the `prebuilt/` directory.
For each successful run you can download these from the
[build-all workflow](https://github.com/worldforge/worldforge/actions/workflows/build-all.yml)
on GitHub Actions. Select a successful run and expand **Artifacts** to find the
`prebuilt` archive and its `prebuilt-manifest` checksum file.

Runs on the `master` branch also publish a `prebuilt.tar.gz` and accompanying
`manifest.sha256` file on the [Releases](https://github.com/worldforge/worldforge/releases) page.
Each CI build verifies that the `prebuilt/` directory contains files and logs the
archive size and SHA256 checksum for traceability.
Verify downloads with:

```bash
sha256sum -c manifest.sha256
tar -xzf prebuilt.tar.gz
./prebuilt/bin/cyphesis --help
```

Artifacts are published only for workflow runs where all tests pass.

### CMake < 3.23

If your CMake tool is an earlier version, < 3.23, you can't use the "presets" system with Conan. Instead you have to
issue these commands:

```bash
conan remote add worldforge https://artifactory.ogenvik.org/artifactory/api/conan/conan-local
conan install . --build missing -c tools.system.package_manager:mode=install -c tools.system.package_manager:sudo=True
mkdir -p build/Release && cd build/Release
cmake ../.. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=build/Release/generators/conan_toolchain.cmake -DCMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP0091=NEW -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install/release
cmake --build . -j --target all
cmake --build . -j --target install
cmake --build . -j --target mediarepo-checkout 
cmake --build . -j --target media-process-install 
```

### Tests

The test suite can be built and run using the ```check``` target. For example:

```bash
cmake --build --preset conan-release --target check
```

### API documentation

If Doxygen is available API documentation can be generated using the ```dox``` target. For example:

```bash
cmake --build --preset conan-release --target dox
```

### Building libraries

By default, all components will be built and only the server and client will be installed. However, you can force
installation of libs also either by setting the CMake variable "NO_LIBS_INSTALL" to "FALSE", or by invoking CMake in the
directory of the lib you want to build.

## Developing locally

We use Conan for our dependency handling. If you're developing locally you can issue this command to setup both a "
debug" and "release" environment.

```bash
conan install -s build_type=Debug . --build missing -c tools.system.package_manager:mode=install -c tools.system.package_manager:sudo=True --update  && conan install . --build missing -c tools.system.package_manager:mode=install -c tools.system.package_manager:sudo=True --update
```

You might also want to look into the ```.gdbinit``` file to see how you can set it up to ungrab the mouse when
debugging.

### Widgets as plugins

When developing it's good to be able to reload UI widgets without having to restart Ember. This can be achieved by
building UI widgets as "plugins". In this mode the UI widgets are build as shared objects (.so/.dll) and are reloaded
whenever they are changed (which is whenever they are recompiled and reinstalled by CMake).

To enable this you need to add the "widgets_as_plugins=True" flag to the "conan install" command as described above.
For example:

```bash
conan install -s build_type=Debug . --build missing -c tools.system.package_manager:mode=install -c tools.system.package_manager:sudo=True -o "widgets_as_plugins=True"
```

## Running a server

To get a server running you need to build the project and then start the "cyphesis" artifact.

## Running a client

To get a client running you need to build the project and then start the "ember" artifact.

## Worlds data

This repository does not contain any of the demonstration worlds that we provide, since they often change a lot. They
can instead be found at [Worldforge Worlds](https://github.com/worldforge/worlds). If you build through Conan these
will be automatically installed and used. However, if you're setting up your own world you probably want to clone the
Worlds repository and use that instead. You can either configure Cyphesis to load from a different location by setting
WORLDFORGE_WORLDS_PATH at CMake time, or by altering the content of "cyphesis.vconf.in" ("autoimport" setting).

## Media

When building and running Cyphesis you need access to the media, which is stored in Subversion. The Subversion server is
at https://svn.worldforge.org:886/svn/media/trunk. The CMake command "mediarepo-checkout" will do a "sparse" checkout
which will only fetch a subset of media, omitting source media. If you intend to do development and need the full media
you can issue the CMake command "mediarepo-checkout-full" instead which will checkout all media.

Media is stored in "app/cyphesis/mediarepo".

### Conan packages

We use Conan for our third party dependencies. In most cases we use the packages provided
by [Conan Center](https://conan.io/center), but in some cases we need to provide our own packages. These can all be
found in the [tools/conan-packages](tools/conan-packages) directory.
