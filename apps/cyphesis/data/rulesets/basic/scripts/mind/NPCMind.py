    An NPCMind object is associated with all NPC and similar entities on a
    game server. It handles perception data from the world, tracks what
    the NPC knows about, and handles its goals.

    The data is organized into three key data structures:

    self.map is handled by the underlying C++ code, and contains a copy of
    all the entities in the world that this NPC is currently able to perceive.

    self.knowledge contains data triples which define relations between
    entities.

    self.goals and self.trigger_goals contain trees of goals which represent
    current and potential activities that NPC might engage in. self.goals are
    goals which are checked each tick, self.trigger_goals are goals which
    are activated by an event."""
