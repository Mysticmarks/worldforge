.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The cyphesis tools manage the data and configuration files used by cyphesis.
.PP
The \fBcyconfig\fR program provides an easy scriptable way to
make permanent changes to the server config from the command line.
It works by writing new config options to \fI\&.cyphesis.vconf\fR
in the users home directory, which is read by the server at startup,
and overrides the contents of the main config file. For a description of
the various options that the server takes, please see 
\fBcyphesis\fR(1)\&.
.PP
The \fBcypasswd\fR tool is used to administrate the accounts table
in the server database.
.PP
The \fBcyexport\fR tool exports entities (and optionally rules) from
a running server into a file. The file generated can be imported into a server
through the tool \fBcyimport\fR\&.
.PP
When establishing local connections automatically, these tools create temporary system accounts protected with cryptographically
secure random passwords that offer at least 128 bits of entropy.
.PP
The \fBcyimport\fR tool imports entities and rules from a file,
previously exported through the \fBcyexport\fR tool, into a
running server.
.PP
The \fBcypython\fR tool allows you to execute Python code in a 
running server. This command must be run on the same machine as the server 
(it uses domain sockets for communication with the server). When run the user
is presented with an interactive console into which Python code can be entered.
Commands are sent to the server by pressing enter.
.PP
The \fBcydb\fR tool is used to perform maintanence on the server
database. Use only when the server is offline.
The first argument specified which dataset to work with, and the second argument 
specifies the action for that data set.
The following datasets are supported:
.TP
\fBuser\fR
Purge, list, delete or modify user entries.
.TP
\fBworld\fR
Purge the world of all entities.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The \fBcypasswd\fR can either add a new account, set the password
of an existing account, or remove an account from the database. When no
arguments are given, it prompts for a new admin password for cyphesis.
When run with the \fB-a\fR option, the command prompts for a
password to be entered and an account with the username given by \fBaccount\fR,
and with the password supplied at the prompt is created. When run with the
\fB-s\fR option, the command prompts for a password, and the
existing account with username given by \fBaccount\fR has its password changed to
the new one entered.  When run with the \fB-d\fR option, the
account with username given by \fBaccount\fR is removed from the database.
.PP
Whenever the \fBcypasswd\fR prompts for a password, a second
prompt is displayed asking for confirmation of the password. If the two
password entered do not match, the operation is aborted, and no changes are
made to the database.
.PP
The \fBcyexport\fR by default only exports entities, but can also 
export rules through the option \fB--export:rules=1\fR\&.
By default no transient entities are exported. This can be changed by the 
option \fB--export:transients=1\fR
