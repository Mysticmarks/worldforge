 * are discovered or moves. The awareness area is typically an area which will encompass the terrain between the
 * avatar and the destination, together with some padding.

 * Note that this class currently is optimized for a flat world with only one layer. Furthermore all entities are only
 * handled through their bounding box. As the world progresses and support for more complex geometry is added, as well
 * as more complete physics simulation, this class needs to be expanded.
 *
 * Internally this class uses a dtTileCache to manage the tiles. Since the world is dynamic we need to manage the
 * navmeshes through tiles in order to keep the resource usage down.
