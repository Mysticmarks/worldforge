Mercator is primarily aimed at terrain for multiplayer online games and
forms one of the [WorldForge](http://worldforge.org/ "The main Worldforge site")
core libraries.
It is intended to be used as a terrain library on both the client and the
server.

## Design 
Mercator is designed in such a way that individual tiles can be
generated on-the-fly from a very small source data set.  Each tile uses
a fast deterministic random number generation to ensure that identical
results are produced "anytime, anywhere".  This enables transmission of
terrain across low bandwidth links as part of the standard data stream,
or server side collision detection with the same terrain that the
player sees. 

The use of tiles means that there is inherently a large degree of gross
control of the shape of the terrain.  Finer control is implemented by
allowing geometric modifications - for example, a polygonal area might
be flattened, or a crater could be applied.

### Height generation
* uses deterministic random number generation and seeds to
  generate detailed terrain from sparse control points.
* each tile is seeded using the four surrounding control points
* shape of each tile is influenced by height, roughness and
  falloff parameters

### Height Modifications
* geometric modifications can be applied for small features
* new types of modifications can be added quite easily

### Shading
* generate shading information based on height and gradient
* new types of shaders can be added quite easily
* polygonal areas may be marked as holes to carve out unshaded regions
* used on the client side

### Collision
basic terrain intersection/collision functions are implemented for
* bbox
* point
* ray

### Vegetation
Basic support for generation of forests in much the same way as terrain.
Forest shape (polygonal) is supported
Tree location, orientation and height are generated from a random seed.
Currently incomplete and has hardcoded parameters

### Current Limitations
* multiple resolutions in the one terrain are unsupported
